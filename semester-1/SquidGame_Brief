In the glass bridge challenge in the Netflix show "Squid Game", there are n contestants who have to cross a glass bridge in order, according to their number.

There are 17 jump choices to be made to get across the bridge. A contestant can choose to either jump to the left or to the right.

Unknown to the participants, one side will collapse under their weight and lead to their elimination, while the other side is correct.
Participants have to be successful with a 50/50 guess to progress another step forwards and there are 17 steps in total.

Assume that every time any player makes a jump from any position into any other position, they have a 1% chance of just falling off the bridge by accident. 
Thus, nobody ever has a 100% chance of making it across. 

Write a Monte Carlo simulation that calculates the % chance, to the nearest percent, that player n will survive. 
For example, when n is 5 then the answer is 2%, because the 5th player has a 2% chance of surviving. The Monte Carlo simulation should take one parameter, namely n.
